### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Adam and I'm just starting with git and github.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
Actually my main project is ***Tetris in ReactJS***. I have learned a lot since I started making it and I still have some ideas to add.

My second project is ***KoÅ‚a zÄ™bate ZFA-75***, yea I know it may sounds scary :sweat_smile: but it's my opensource app for individual customer. Actually there are many things I can add to this project but it's not necessary to do it at this moment.

You can also see some of my projects here: [My dashboard on codepen](https://codepen.io/dashboard/)

>I'm also working on some little projects but they're in their really early version so they are not ready to add them here.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
I'm actually learning React JS, but in my planes I also have things like:  
**- Redux**  
**- React Native**  
**- Node.js**  
**- MongoDB**  
**- automatic tests**  
**- npm**  
**- pwa**  

*I know that IT technologies are changing really fast and I'm ready to change my plans. I'm focus on possibilities.*  :relieved:
